Recreate the design as seen in "Design.png".
Focus on good structure.
Some of the icons you can probably get via font-awesome: https://fontawesome.com/
use the Bulma Framework to accelerate your work: https://bulma.io/
The font used can be applied by including : https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@100;200;400;500&display=swap in your <head>
focus on:

1.  building a good structure / skeleton (position things)
2.  once this is achieved, apply basic imagine (background + normal images)
3.  only after the above is done do colors/font-sizes and other decoration
4.  remember there is a background-color value that removes all default color so you can get the nice text on image effect :)
